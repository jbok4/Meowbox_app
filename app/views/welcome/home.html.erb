<h1>Welcome to Meowbox</h1>
<h3>Cat toys, Cat treats, A box!</h3>
<p>A monthly cat subscription box filled with fun unique toys and goodies</p>

<h4>We have three monthly plans!<br> <%= link_to "Click more details", subscriptions_path %></h4>

<h4>Cat toys</h4>
<p>We select toys and accessories that are fun and stimulating. Excitement can come as a potent catnip bird, cat grass seeds about to sprout, a squeaky mouse, or a handmade bow tie. We search the globe for goodies that will shake up kittyâ€™s daily routine.</p>

<h4>Cat treats</h4>
<p>All edible items are carefully sourced from Canada or the US. Tasty treats are often single-ingredient, natural, or handmade. We search for foods which are healthy, grain-free, or local. We want kitty to discover treats that are yummy and guilt-free.</p>

<h4>A box!</h4>
<p>Your cat may suggest that the box is the best part! In a few months, kitty will come to recognize and love this special box. Rumour has it that this behaviour is because the cardboard is sprayed with a magical kitty potion.</p>
